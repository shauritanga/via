## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Firebase project setup
- Supabase project setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd via
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project
   - Add your `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)
   - Update `lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase configuration

4. **Configure Supabase**
   - Create a Supabase project
   - Update `lib/config/supabase_config.dart` with your Supabase credentials
   - Set up storage buckets (see Storage Setup section)

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üì¶ Storage Setup

The app uses Supabase for file storage. You need to create the following buckets in your Supabase dashboard:

### Required Buckets

1. **images**
   - Public: Yes
   - Size limit: 10MB
   - MIME types: `image/*`

2. **videos**
   - Public: Yes
   - Size limit: 50MB
   - MIME types: `video/*`

3. **documents**
   - Public: Yes
   - Size limit: 50MB
   - MIME types: `application/pdf`, `application/msword`, `text/*`

### Storage Policies

Create RLS (Row Level Security) policies for each bucket:

```sql
-- Public read access for images
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');

-- Public read access for videos
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for videos" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'videos');

-- Public read access for documents
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents');

-- Authenticated users can upload to their own folders
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload to own folder" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```
